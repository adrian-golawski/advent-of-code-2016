# Advent of Code 2016's solutions

This year I am solving all [Advent of Code 2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016/) solutions in Rust, while providing as many fun visualisations as I can.

Enjoy the Demo that I deployed on [here on GitHub Pages](https://adrian-golawski.github.io/advent-of-code-2016/).

My project is written with [egui](https://www.egui.rs/) that allows me to build the app as WebAssembly package that you can run on your browser.
```
trunk build --release --public-url=advent-of-code-2016/
```

To test the solutions locally, you can clone the repository and run:
```shell
cargo run
```
